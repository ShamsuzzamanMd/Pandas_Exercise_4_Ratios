1. The structure of the script is well structured
2. Task by task it was done nicely 
3. Clean codes!
4. They did every questions as it is expected from the guidelines.  

Note: May be they can correct the task "Step 5" for the ration values, because the values cannot be 100 (the range of ratio should be 0 to 1).
